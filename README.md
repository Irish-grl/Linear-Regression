1.	Click on the following link to interact with the multivariable linear regression model's code and user interface that's hosted on Binder.org:
     https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Irish-grl/Linear-Regression/main?labpath=Retirement%20Savings%20Interest%20Generator%20-%20LM%20(7).ipynb
     
2.   Click on the button called 'Run' and select 'Run All Cells'. It will take several minutes for the full program to load and the user interface to generate a browser      window with the web application. 

3.   Enter an 'age' as a number and then press the 'submit' button.

4.   Enter a 'gross yearly salary' as a number and then press the 'submit' button.

5.   The estimated amount you should put away for retirement each year will populate on the web application page.

6.   The 'main.py' file is not required to run the Retirement Savings Interest Generator Tool, but is added for clarity on how the random ages were generated that were        added to the data set. It can be viewed on Github and on Binder.org.

## Important notes:

If you close out of the web application's browser page and try to re-run the program again without completely shutting down, you will receive the following error message:          'SessionClosedException'

You will need to click on the 'Kernel' button in Binder and select 'Shut Down All Kernels...', then click the 'Run' button and select 'Run All Cells' and wait for the web application to regenerate in order to interact with the web application again without receiving an error message.
